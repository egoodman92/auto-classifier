# Audio Classification of Accelerating Vehicles

In this project, we used different machine learning techniques to classify vehicles accelerating from a stop. In classification, specific focus was on applying support vector machines, recurrent neural networks, and vanilla fully-connected neural networks to distinguish between anywhere from two to seven different types of vehicles.
